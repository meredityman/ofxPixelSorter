ofxPixelSorter
=====================================

Introduction
------------
This addon impliments pixel sorting on loaded images. It allows you to configure the sort direction, method etc... I've tried to make this as quick as possible by multi-threading the sorting opperation.

Dependencies
------------
The [`example-maximal`](https://github.com/meredityman/ofxPixelSorter/tree/master/example-maximal) uses [`ofxImGui`](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui) to build a simple UI.

Compatibility
------------
Tested with Windows an OSX.
